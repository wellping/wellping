# FAQ

## Why is `ios.bundleIdentifier` different from `android.package` in `app.json`?

Our developer account for App Store is an individual account (becaue SSNL is not a "legal entity"). So our bundle ID for iOS cannot refer to SSNL or to Stanford. So we have to set it to `"app.wellping"`. On the other hand, there is no such restriction for Google Play, so we keep the `"edu.stanford.ssnl.wellping"` for Android.

## Who designed Well Ping's logo?

[Wicia Fang](https://wiciafang.com/) worked on the logo's design!
