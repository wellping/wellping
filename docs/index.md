Well Ping uses **[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)** (with **[Expo](https://expo.dev/)**) and is written purely in **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**.

The main benefit of using React Native is we could write only one set of TypeScript code to support both iOS and Android devices. With Expo, it also allows easy setup and development without needing to worry about any native iOS or Android code.
