To use the content in this folder as a study file, please use

- **(for `debug/DEBUG_STUDY.json` study file)** `https://debug.local.wellping.ssnl.stanford.edu/DEBUG_STUDY.json` (defined by `WELLPING_LOCAL_DEBUG_URL` constant)

**Note: due to technical restrictions (we could not load YAML into the app), you will only be able to use JSON files as the study file.**

> You may use tools such as [js-yaml CLI executable](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml#cli-executable) to generate the JSON file from the YAML file.
