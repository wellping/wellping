- **(for `debug/DEBUG_STUDY.json` study file)** `https://debug.local.wellping.ssnl.stanford.edu/DEBUG_STUDY.json` (defined by `WELLPING_LOCAL_DEBUG_URL` constant)

**Note: due to technical restrictions, YAML files could not be loaded into the app. As such, you will only be able to use JSON files here. If you want to test a YAML file, you need to host it somewhere on the Internet. Alternatively, you can use tools such as [js-yaml CLI executable](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml#cli-executable) to generate a JSON file from the YAML file and put it here.**
